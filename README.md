# rock-vs-mine-prediction
Rock vs. mine prediction is a machine learning problem that involves classifying sonar signals as either a "rock" or a "mine" based on their acoustic properties. The data used for this problem typically consists of a set of sonar signals that have been labeled as either "rock" or "mine" based on human interpretation.
 machine learning algorithms are trained on a subset of the data (the training set) to learn the relationship between the acoustic properties of the sonar signals and their corresponding labels. This typically involves preprocessing the data to extract relevant features (such as frequency components,and  wavelet transformsand then applying a classification algorithm (such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines) to the features to make predictions.

The trained model can then be tested on a separate subset of the data (the test set) to evaluate its accuracy and generalization performance. The performance of the model can be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

The rock vs. mine prediction problem is a useful example of how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems in areas such as oceanography, naval defense, and environmental monitoring. By accurately classifying sonar signals as rocks or mines, machine learning models can help improve the safety and efficiency of marine activities, and also aid in scientific research.
